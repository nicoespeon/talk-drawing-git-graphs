# Drawing Git Graphs in the Browser

---

This is the story of a problem I had.

---

<Image src="./images/1-us.jpg" />

---

Business school.

---

Git classes = need to show git graphs.

---

Git graphs in slides are a pain in the ass!

---

Git graphs on web page are a pain in the ass!

---

nvdie inspiration: beautiful! But Keynote based = Pain in the ass to maintain.

---

Discussing at swimming pool: what if…

---

When you have a crazy idea in mind… do it.

You can **hack** your own problems!

---

Fabien had a POC. We worked on it until v1. It was awesome!

---

Demo of v1 usage.

---

v1 was awesome:

- git API drawing graph in browser Canvas
- highly customisable
- no dependency (vanity metric)
- open-source
- fun website => show it!

---

Then, you have to maintain.

---

How do you deal with issues? With PRs?

---

Not really using it anymore => slow updates.

---

Modelling of v1 was good, but not good enough. Hard to implement features (import from JSON, branch labels…).

---

No test. How to test such a thing?

---

Fabien is the hacker. I'm the doer. (Metidia image)

---

Maintaining cost more and more as you should not break existing stuff.

---

An OK execution is better than a perfect idea.

Hack your way out of your problem.

---

In 2017, it was time to move from v1. We want:

- tests
- better separation of responsibilities
- types & modern tooling

---

Fabien started v2 (he's the doer, be like Fabien).

--

Features:

- distinct the rendering part from the calculation part (core)
- TDD the core!
- modularity & types with TypeScript (better DX)

---

Structure we designed:

- core
- react, using SVG rendering
- eventually others: angular, vanilla JS, vue.js… node.js!

---

He did the POC. I was leaving for Montréal, Canada.

**Weekly remote pair-programming!**

---

You'd be surprised how efficient pair-programming + TDD could be, even in ~30min of code.

---

We built v2 slowly like that, over 1 year.

---

Fun facts for you:

- How to be efficient for remote pair-programming
- Prettier to ease your life
- SVG rendering of arrow (maths)
- SVG rendering of tooltips (maths & how to keep it readable)
- SVG rendering of commits dots (fun with browser stroke)
- How to ease maintenance of multiple packages (tips for monorepo)
- How to maintain 2 really different versions of the codebase? (git worktree)
- Private stuff in TS appear as public in JS version + Intellisense!

---

v2 is out!
