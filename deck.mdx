# Drawing Git Graphs in the Browser

---

This is the story of a problem I had.

---

<Image src="./images/1-us.jpg" />

---

Business school. Git presentations.

---

Git graphs in slides are a pain in the ass.

---

When you have a crazy idea in mind… do it.

You can **hack** your own problems!

---

v1 was awesome:

- git API drawing graph in browser Canvas
- highly customisable
- no dependency
- fun website

---

Then, you have to maintain.

---

Modelling of v1 was good, but not good enough.

---

No test. How to test such a thing?

---

An OK execution is better than a perfect idea.

Hack your way out of your problem.

---

Fabien started v2:

- distinct the rendering part from the calculation part (core)
- TDD the core!
- modularity & types with TypeScript (better DX)

---

He did the POC. I was leaving for Montréal, Canada.

**Weekly remote pair-programming!**

---

We built the new lib slowly. We didn't have to rush (not an urgent problem).

---

v2 is out!
